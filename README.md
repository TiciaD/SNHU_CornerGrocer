# SNHU Corner Grocer
## Overview
The Corner Grocer needs a program that analyzes the text records they generate throughout the day. These records list items purchased in chronological order from the time the store opens to the time it closes. They are interested in rearranging their produce section and need to know how often items are purchased so they can create the most effective layout for their customers. 

Your task is to build an item-tracking program for the Corner Grocer, which should incorporate all of their requested functionality using both C++ and Python.

## Functionality
Address the following:
1. Produce a list of all items purchased in a given day along with the number of times each item was purchased.
2. Produce a number representing how many times a specific item was purchased in a given day.
3. Produce a text-based histogram listing all items purchased in a given day, along with a representation of the number of times each item was purchased.
